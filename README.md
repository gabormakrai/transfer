Transfer - Traffic Assignment Environment
========

Transfer is a Java based traffic assignment environment. Its primary purpose is to scientifically investigate and analyse different algorithms and techniques used to solve the Traffic Assignment Problem.

This project contains classes to parse all the necessary files for the solver, classed for the solvers themselves and classes to write out the results.

There are some related github projects connected to this project:
* [transfer-data](https://github.com/gabormakrai/transfer-data): project contains a collection of publicly available dataset for the Traffic Assignment Problem
* [transfer-benchmark](https://github.com/gabormakrai/transfer-benchmark): project contains performance analysis of different TAP solver algorithms on datasets found in transfer-data project

### TAP algorithms

##### Frank-Wolfe algorithm (FW)

This algorithm was used firstly to solve the TAP. More details can be found in *Frank, M., & Wolfe, P. (1956). An algorithm for quadratic programming. Naval research logistics quarterly, 3(1‚Äê2), 95-110.*

##### Path Equilibrium algorithm (PE)

The original solution proposed to solve the TAP was the PE algorithm however that time it was considered to inpractical because its large memory requirement. More detauls can be found in *Dafermos, S. C., & Sparrow, F. T. (1969). The traffic assignment problem for a general network. Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards, Series B, 73(2), 91-118.*
