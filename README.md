Transfer - Traffic Assignment Environment
========

Transfer is a Java based traffic assignment environment. Its primary purpose is to scientifically investigate and analyse different algorithms and techniques used to solve the Traffic Assignment Problem.

This project contains classes to parse all the necessary files for the solver, classed for the solvers themselves and classes to write out the results.

There are some related github projects connected to this project:
* [transfer-data](http://github.com/gabormakrai/trasfer-data): project contains a collection of publicly available dataset for the Traffic Assignment Problem
* [transfer-benchmark](http://github.com/gabormakrai/transfer-benchmark): project contains performance analysis of different TAP solver algorithms on datasets found in transfer-data project
